    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <!-- task one -->
        <li><h2>Completed portfolio assignment</h2>
            <div><h3>Questions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Page 67 of 'doing stuff', code line #11. 'if(numberAsText != “” && !isNaN(aNumber)', What does the logic after the = sign mean?
                        <p>NaN means Not-A-Number. That logic means if numberAsText is not a string and it is a number, then do the following.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>What does toLocaleString mean? It is a function that converts the date and time stamp to a string.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>

        <!-- task 2 -->
        <li><h2>Watched the Master Mobile UX video</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Notes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Responsive retrofitting does does not equal mobile first.</li>

                <li>Do mobile first! do not try to shove a marshmallow into a piggy bank.</li>

                <li>Slow loading apps loose money. I should reduce image size, optimize CSS and JS files, and GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data. This will help reduce loading time.</li>

                <li>Reachability is very important, on mobile devices moving the primary controls (menu) to the bottom of the screen increases reachability.</li>

                <li>Many user do not know what a hamburger menu is, the word menu make to look like a button is the best option.</li>

                <li>Make the app easy to understand and use and focus on the most important things first.</li>

                <li>Design intuitive and mobile friendly forms. Make labels into float labels (display inside the field) and make inputs bigger.</li>

                <li>If using pagination to complete forms, make sure to include a progress indicator.</li>

                <li>Masking passwords doesn't even increase security, but it does cost business due to login failures.</li>

                <li>Display the correct keyboard for the type of data that the user needs to enter. Make check boxes bigger and easy to select.</li>

                <li>Do not use pop ups/pop overs, in between adds or auto play music and audio. Keep it simple and make sure adds are unobtrusive, the content first!</li>

            </ul>
        </div></li>

         <!-- task 3 -->
         <li><h2>Doing Stuff with Web</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Notes:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>JSON is use to convert anything to text, and it allows the text to be converted back to the original thing.</li>
                    <li>parse = To examine a string character by character to determine what the string mean.</li>
                    <li>JSON.stringify = function that converts stuff into a string.</li>
                    <li>localStorage.setItem(“all_notes”, allNotesString) = local storage, store the allNotesString variable content using the key 'all_notes' so I can get it later.</li>
                    <li>localStorage.getItem(“all_notes”) = local storage, get back what is store in key 'all_notes' as string representing an array of messages.</li>
    
                </ul>
            </div></li>

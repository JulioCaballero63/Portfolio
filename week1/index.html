    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <!-- task one -->
        <li><h2>Completed portfolio assignment</h2>
            <div><h3>Questions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a place to write questions down.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>

        <!-- task 2 -->
        <li><h2>Watched the Master Mobile UX video</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Notes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Responsive retrofitting does does not equal mobile first.</li>

                <li>Do mobile first! do not try to shove a marshmallow into a piggy bank.</li>

                <li>Slow loading apps loose money. I should reduce image size, optimize CSS and JS files, and GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data. This will help reduce loading time.</li>

                <li>Reachability is very important, on mobile devices moving the primary controls (menu) to the bottom of the screen increases reachability.</li>

                <li>Many user do not know what a hamburger menu is, the word menu make to look like a button is the best option.</li>

                <li>Make the app easy to understand and use and focus on the most important things first.</li>

                <li>Design intuitive and mobile friendly forms. Make labels into float labels (display inside the field) and make inputs bigger.</li>

                <li>If using pagination to complete forms, make sure to include a progress indicator.</li>

                <li>Masking passwords doesn't even increase security, but it does cost business due to login failures.</li>

                <li>Display the correct keyboard for the type of data that the user needs to enter.</li>

                <li>Do not use pop ups/pop overs, in between adds or auto play music and audio. Keep it simple and make sure adds are unobtrusive, the content first!</li>


            </ul>
        </div></li>

        <!-- task 3 -->
        <li><h2>Report</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>What did I do since the last meeting?
                    <ul>
                    <li>I set up the programs I need for this course.</li>
                    <li>I had trouble setting up Sitepoint, but with help from a fellow student I was able to figure it out.</li>
                </ul></li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Try to complete my weekly assignments the best I can.</li>
                        <li>I am having a hard time following the instructions this week, but I will use slack to ask questions and make sure I have all of my assignments completed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What are my blockers?
                    <ul>
                        <li>My biggest challenge this week was setting up Sitepoint. The instructions were not very clear to me.</li>
                        <li>I am having a hard time following along with the assignments, I find the instruction confusing. Make check boxes bigger and easy to select.</li>

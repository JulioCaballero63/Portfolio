                    <h3>Notes from reading:</h3>
                    <ul class="inner-content">

                        <li>
                            <p>Functions have built-in properties such as length, but can have custom properties added.
                            </p>


                            <p> All functions have call() and apply() methods that can invoke a function with the value
                                of this bound to an object that is provided as an argument.</p>

                            <p> Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs are functions that are enclosed in
                                parentheses and immediately followed by double parentheses so they’re invoked. They are
                                useful for namespacing variables and setting default values.</p>

                            <p> Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function,
                                depending on certain conditions.</p>

                            <p> A recursive function will keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met.</p>

                            <p> A callback is a function that’s provided as an argument to another function.</p>

                            <p> Callbacks are frequently used in asynchronous programming as part of the event loop.
                                This means that a program can continue to run in a single thread while waiting for
                                another task to be completed.</p>

                            <p> Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions in
                                sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors.</p>

                            <p> Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.</p>

                            <p> A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the
                                scope of
                                the function it was originally defined in.</p>

                            <p> A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the function keyword.
                            </p>

                            <p> A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a next() method, which
                                returns the next value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function.</p>

                            <p> Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied
                                as a
                                series of functions.</p>

                            <p> Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they are called
                                from,
                                have no side-effects, and always give the same result when given the same arguments
                                (referential transparency).</p>

                            <p> Currying or partial application is the process of applying one argument at a time to a
                                function. A new function is returned until all the arguments have been used.</p>

                            <p>Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.</p>

                            <p>The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.</p>

                            <p>Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload.
                            </p>

                            <p>Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.</p>

                            <p>Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.</p>

                            <p>The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request or to
                                create your own response objects.</p>

                            <p>The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information
                                about the request being made, such as the URL and headers.</p>

                            <p>The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added to a request or
                                response object.</p>

                            <p>Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.</p>

                            <p>The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.</p>

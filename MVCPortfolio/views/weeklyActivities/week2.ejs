                    <h3>Questions:</h3>
                    <ul class="inner-content">
                        <li>
                            <h4>What is a set and how do I use it?</h4>
                            <p>A set is a data structure that represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot
                                include any duplicate values. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>How do you create a set:</h4>
                            <p>An empty set is created using the new operator and Set() constructor:</p>
                            <p>const list = new Set();</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>How to add values to a set:</h4>
                            <p>list.add(1);</p>
                            <p>Set { 1 }</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Multiple items can be added to the set by repeating the add() method:</p>
                            <p>list.add(2).add(3).add(4);</p>
                            <p>Set { 1, 2, 3, 4 }</p>
                            <p>or like this using an array as an argument:</p>
                            <p>const numbers = new Set([1,2,3]);</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>What is memory leak?</h4>
                            <p>A memory leak occurs when a program retains references to values that can no longer be
                                accessed in its memory. This means that memory is being used to store values that are no
                                longer required by the program, effectively wasting system resources.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>What are Maps?</h4>
                            <p>Maps were another data structure introduced in the ES6 specification. They are a
                                convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and are similar to 'hashes', or
                                'hash tables' or 'dictionaries' in other programming languages.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>How is map different than an object:</h4>
                            <p>Objects are limited to using strings for key values, whereas maps can use any data type
                                as a key.</p>
                            <p>There is no efficient way to find the number of key-value pairs an object has, whereas
                                this is easy to do with maps using the size property.</p>
                            <p>Objects have methods that can be called (see Chapter 5) and prototypes that can be used
                                to create a chain of inheritance (see Chapter 12), whereas maps are solely focused on
                                the storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.</p>
                            <p>The value of an object's properties can be accessed directly, whereas maps restrict you
                                to using the get() method to retrieve any values.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>How to create a map?</h4>
                            <p>An empty map object can be created using the new operator and Map() constructor:</p>
                            <p>const romanNumerals = new Map();</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>How to add values to a map?</h4>
                            <p>romanNumerals.set(2,'II').set(3,'III').set(4,'IV').set(5,'V');</p>
                            <p>Map { 1 => 'I', 2 => 'II', 3 => 'III', 4 => 'IV', 5 => 'V' }</p>
                        </li>

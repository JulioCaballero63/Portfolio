                        <li>
                            <h4>Transforms and Transitions</h4>
                            <p>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any
                                element on the page. While some of these effects were possible using previously existing
                                CSS features (such as translating with relative and absolute positioning), CSS3 gives
                                you unprecedented control over many more aspects of the element’s appearance.
                            </p>
                            <p>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These
                                functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and
                                left, moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes. When you
                                employ a translation function, you’re moving elements without impacting the flow of the
                                document. Unlike position: relative, which allows you to position an element either
                                against its current position or against a parent or other ancestor, a translated element
                                can only be moved relative to its current position.</p>

                            <p>
                                The <strong>translate(x,y)</strong> function moves an element x from the left, and y
                                from the top:
                                transform: translate(45px, -45px);</p>
                            <p>Transforms don’t work on inline elements. But that’s easy enough to fix. Just add
                                display: inline-block; to your span:</p>
                            <p> The <strong>scale(x,y)</strong> function scales an element by the defined factors
                                horizontally then
                                vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values,
                                growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original
                                aspect ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2)
                                would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on. </p>
                            <p>As with translate, you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions. These functions
                                will scale only the horizontal dimensions or only the vertical dimensions respectively.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>The rotate()</strong> function rotates an element around the point of origin by a
                                specified angle
                                value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is the element’s center. Generally,
                                angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative
                                moving counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be provided in grads,
                                radians, or turns, but we’ll just be sticking with degrees.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>skew(x,y)</strong> function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d
                                expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y
                                axis. </p>

                            <h4>Canvas, SVG, and DRAG and Drop</h4>
                            <p>With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript.
                                This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images
                                off the network. With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and
                                patterns. In addition, canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even
                                video. </p>
                            <p>The coordinate system in the canvas element is different from the Cartesian coordinate
                                system you learned in math class. In the canvas coordinate system, the top-left corner
                                is (0,0). If the canvas is 200 pixels by 200 pixels, then the bottom-right corner is
                                (200,200).</p>
                            <p>You may be asking yourself, “what is that function statement that comes right before the
                                call to img.onload?” It’s an anonymous function. Anonymous functions are much like
                                regular functions except, as you might guess, they are without names.

                                When you see an anonymous function defined as an event listener, it means that the
                                anonymous function is being bound to that event. In other words, the code inside that
                                anonymous function will be run when the load event is fired.</p>

                            <p>Radians are a unit used to measure angles, and the symbol π denotes a measurement in
                                radians. One radian is equal to 180 degrees. Two radians, or 2π, are equal to 360
                                degrees. For a review of radians, see the “Intuitive Guide to Angles, Degrees and
                                Radians” at betterexplained.com.

                                anticlockwise is an optional argument. If you wanted the arc to be drawn
                                counterclockwise instead of clockwise, you would set this value to true. Since we are
                                drawing a full circle, it’s of no consequence which direction we draw it in, so we omit
                                this argument.</p>
